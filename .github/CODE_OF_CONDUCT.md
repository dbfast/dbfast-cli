- Write clean code
- Share knowledge
- Help others debug
- Give constructive feedback 
- Respect the codebase
- Ship working features
- Have technical discussions
- Make cool stuff together

### What We Don't Want
- Harassment (duh)
- Spam/ads
- Toxic behavior
- Drama
- Politics
- Off-topic rants
- Bad faith PRs
- Backdoors/malicious code

## Technical Standards
- Write tests
- Document your code
